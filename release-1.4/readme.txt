= How does Trumpcha work? =

Feature of work Trumpch'a consists in the following. There are 2 boxings - the fleet and the house. In fleet there are 4 playing cards, on one on each suit. 
In a random way trump suit (one of four presented) gets out. It is necessary to transfer a card with trump suit to the house.
To throw off a trump in the house it is possible in two ways:
1. We hook the mouse on trump suit and move it in the house.
2. Mouse click on a special icon on trump suit. As a result suit itself will get to the house.
If suit not trump, it does not get to the house.
Only after trump hit in the house, the user can send the comment.
The warning message will be otherwise given out.
